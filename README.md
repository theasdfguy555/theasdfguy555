Hi, I'm theasdfguy555.
I started learning to program at 15 years old.

This coming weekend, I'm going to try my best to compile LWJGL and MultiMC for ARM as a last hope of keeping Minecraft: Java available to play on Pi.
The new launcher doesn't run on ARM, and I really want to preserve the ability to run it on affordable hardware.

I barely know anything about compiling other people's code, especially for a different architecture. Wish me luck.
If I succeed, I'll put it up as forks of the originals.
